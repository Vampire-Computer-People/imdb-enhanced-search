# Custom Film Finder

Ever been on the hunt for a cool movie to watch but sick of browsing whatever is on Netflix? Want to learn how to hack data and write personalized queries custom built to your unique taste?

Having Python 3 installed is a pre-requisite to this workshop. https://www.python.org/downloads/ - Mac users can also use Homebrew - https://brew.sh/

0. pip install -r requirements.txt
0. python runner.py

Observe data being downloaded. This is in tsv - tab separated format. Wait til it says filtering.

Check the resultant csv.

Watch it filtering. Check a movie.

That was cool. What happened.

Entry point is config.ini - change settings here - new filters, add values, comma separated - rebuild.

runner runs the build, and then the filter. explain classes.

We use the configparser, built in python library - explain libraries.

We download data from imdb, then use Pandas to merge both records.

Pandas - explain this lib.

merge using an inner join. explain inner join, explain tconst field. only records where both are included.

then we filter - explain python list comprehension.
